# Django Core Admin

By default, the Rent Free Media CMS menus do not include all available admin options, but rather just the most commonly used ones.  Of particular note here is social login support for user accounts that you may wish to employ, and more Stripe data you may wish to see.

These admin menu items are still available in the core Django admin, which is available at [https://yourdomain.com/django-admin](https://yourdomain.com/django-admin)

As this project progresses we will hopefully get feature parity with the Django admin and be able to completely disable it, but for now it is available if you need it at the above address.  PRs to add more functionality to the CMS admin are welcome, particularly for social logins.
